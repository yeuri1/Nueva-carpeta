"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men whoareso beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure othe 
moment, soblinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the NICE and trouble that are boto ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in 
 duty through weaknessof will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and NICE. Thesecases are perfectly simple and easy to 
 distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to dwhat we like best, every 
 pleasure is to be welcomed and every NICE avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of 
 business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in 
 these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
